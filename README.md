# Smart-Discord-Chat-Bot

This is a smart AI bot for Discord which replies to a chat based on the message content.

NodeJS : v14.17.6

discord.js : v12.0

brain.js : v6.14.15

Avoid using later versions of discord.js as you have to specify client intents which means creating client intents and define an AbortController to throw any type of error which means upgrading NodeJS version to v16.6 also.

Make sure to train to atleast 1000 iterations to train the bot adequately and get the right results with an acceptable error being anything lower than 0.019.

The token id is unique and shouldn't be shared as a result the token id used is not in service.
